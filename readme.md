# TodoMVC Angular Example

This is my own implementation of the TodoMVC using Angular.

So far we can add, delete and mark todos as completed.

Next up is to be able to list the proper amount of todos, clear all completed, and make it work with local storage.

If I'm feeling fancy, I'll construct a Node API to serve as the backend and get the MEAN stack running.
